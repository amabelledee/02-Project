# Bookgiggidy Book Giggidy Event Management System.

## Overview
Take the hassle out of organizing events with Bookgiggidy!
Bookgiggidy is an entertainment app that helps event coordinators
manage all their events, vendors, artists, and budget, all in one place.

Bookgiggidy organizes vendors, events and locations in an overview dashboard to help entertainment administrator better manage, confirm and distribute entertainment services across multiple locations. The unique twist to this situation is that yachts are the venue where services are needed and locations can change from port to port. The venues will need to be re-assignable. Which also makes this a perfect model for franchises organizations.

Current version: Is a series of excel sheets that update events weekly. The vendor list is also excel sheet but more stable due to it being employees.

Challenges to solve: Each service is assigned to the need of each event and some are at times last minute urgency level(needed within 48 hours). Sometimes locations will change from one port to another. For example the yacht will change the event from newport beach to marina del rey. Services need to adjust. When DJ/Musician calls in sick finding replacement is difficult without excel sheets and availability. No way to see current cost of entertainment per event, per week, etc.

We have consolidated the sheets into a simple data table containing example events with assigned vendors. We have added the dynamic data to the dashboard to display list of current events. Also displayed is a list of vendors with easily accessible phone and email links for contacting that vendor to make sure they are ready for the days event. From the event title you can drill down into the details of the event. Which can be filled with specific information pertaining to entertainment and event specs.

Incorporated google calendar to show a master Planner area for administrator to keep track of the current months events.

Future Plans include: Adding the request table to have a side by side comparison of current week gigs with red flags on events that still need services.

Adding Google calendar api to add vendor availability calendars to the master so assigning gigs is visually accessible. This can also include a way to mark as already scheduled once assigned to a gig to avoid double booking. This is also a problem that occures from time to time.

Expand app to include email templates and text capabilities to confirm the gig assigned to them that shows up in master calendar and creates confirmation email for documentation.

The ability to include vendor event details, parking and loading areas with google map api to vendors upon confirming the event.

Ability to track most popular dj/musicians by customer comments and likes campaigns and surveys. To promote that artist more often.

Show running total of cost verse actual spent for bookeeping.

Possible area to view current days events with built in chat app to allow each vendor to check in and actively communicate with administrator in real time.
